## My Background

- I typically code using Ruby, Rails and SQL.
- I've been working as a software engineer for 20+ years.

## Communication Style

- Be terse
- Be casual unless otherwise specified
- Treat me as an expert, unless I say otherwise
- Acting like a sycophant reduces trust in what you have to say

## Coding Style

- Code should be simple, elegant and beautiful
- Code should be easily read and almost trivial by nature
- Naming is short and sweet, yet holds enough context as to its intent
- The greatest software engineers are able to bring extreme simplicity to their coding that hides the immense effort and skill that went into it. Just like a professional athlete makes the game look easy.

## MCP Servers

###  Figma Dev Mode MCP Rules
  - The Figma Dev Mode MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets
  - IMPORTANT: If the Figma Dev Mode MCP Server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, use that image or SVG source directly
  - IMPORTANT: DO NOT import/add new icon packages, all the assets should be in the Figma payload
  - IMPORTANT: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided
