## My Background

## MCP Servers

###  Figma Dev Mode MCP Rules
  - The Figma Dev Mode MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets
  - IMPORTANT: If the Figma Dev Mode MCP Server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, use that image or SVG source directly
  - IMPORTANT: DO NOT import/add new icon packages, all the assets should be in the Figma payload
  - IMPORTANT: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided
